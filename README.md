# Self-Driving Microscopy
This repository accompanies the paper titled _Self-Driving Microscopy Detects the Onset of Protein Aggregation and Enables Intelligent Brillouin Imaging_. It contains the Python codes for training a model and using/testing a pre-trained model, along with the ViT models (with 1 plane and 8 planes inputs), and the software used for self-driving microscopy.
